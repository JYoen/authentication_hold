# authentication_hold

This repository contains the code and datasets described in following paper: Itâ€™s All in the Touch: Authenticating Users with HOST Gestures on Multi-Touch Screen Devices.

## Datasets

We are actively communicating with volunteers to solicit their consent for anonymous data disclosure, as this clause was not included in the initial agreement.

## Code

The code contains three parts: an Android App to collect the sensor data when the screen is touched, a Python Script to extract time- and frequecy- features of the time-series raw data and a Python Script to apply Random Forest and SVM algorithm to build classfiers.

We are about to update the code in few weeks. The Android app has been updated.
